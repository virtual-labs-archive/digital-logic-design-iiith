	This module explains how to build a 4 X 1 Multiplexer.In electronics, a multiplexer or mux is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line.
	Multiplexers were logically designed and used as electronic selector switches.
	A multiplexer of 2n inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.
	Multiplexers are mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over the network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth.
	On the other hand, a demultiplexer (or demux) is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data-output-lines, which is connected to the single input. 
	A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end

An electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple-input, single-output switch, and a demultiplexer as a single-input, multiple-output switch.
</p>
<p>
<bold> 2 X 1 Multiplexer </bold>
<br />
In digital circuit design, the selector wires are of digital value. In the case of a 2-to-1 multiplexer, a logic value of 0 would connect 
I0 to the output while a logic value of 1 would connect I1 to the output. In larger multiplexers, the number of selector pins is equal to 
log2(n) where n is the number of inputs.
</p>
<br />
<br />

<p>
<img src="../images/2X1mux.jpg" alt="2-d vectors" width="200px" style="float:center; margin:10px;"/>
<br />
A 2-to-1 multiplexer has a boolean equation where A and B are the two inputs,  S is the selector input, and Z is the output:
    Z = ( A . S') + (B . S)
    
<br />
</p>
    <p>

    <bold> Truth Table </bold>
	<br />
</p>
    <table border="3" style="float:center;">
	<tr><td>S</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>Z</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>

</table>

<br />
<p>
<bold> 4 X 1 Multiplexer </bold>
<br/>
Larger multiplexers are also common and requires ceil(log2(n)) selector pins for n inputs.
Other common sizes are 4-to-1, 8-to-1, and 16-to-1. Since digital logic uses binary values, powers of 2 are used (4, 8, 16) to maximally control a number of inputs for the given number of selector inputs.

		2) Import two 4:1 multiplexers designed in 1st part and implement a Half adder circuit using these multiplexers. One mux will generate SUM (A ex-or B) and another mux will generate Carry (A.B). 
Now Implement the same using two 2:1 multiplexers. (Hint: choose any one out of A and B as the select bit for multiplexers)

		3) Import two 4:1 multiplexers designed in 1st question and design a 8:1 mux using them. You can use  additional hardware to choose between the outputs of the two multiplexers.
