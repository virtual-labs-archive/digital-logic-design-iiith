	<h2> Step 3: Configure </h2>
	<p>
	This template features a demo of a science lab with a sample "simple pendulum" experiment. To configure this template so that it features your 		lab and its experiments, follow the steps given below.
	</p>	
	<h3> Adding/Modifing the content </h3>
	<p>
	Locate content.html file (It is situated in exp1/ folder) and open it in your favorite html editor. 
	Enter the title of the experiment inside the h1 tag, you see at the top of the page.
	As you can see, this file is divided into number of sections (called divs in html).
	Each section has a unique id which is used to refer to its content globally (from other files). For example, in the sample content.html file, the id for the first div is "introduction" so that it points to introduction part of your experiment content. 
Change the given ids of all the sections of you want to the id-names that you like. Just remember ids should be unique and they should not contain spaces. Use" -" symbol to connect multiple words. For example, "new-simulations" is a valid id. 
	</p>
	<p>  
	Inside the div, you have an h2 tag which is used to create the menu for the experiment page. Therefore, Whatever text you will enter here, will also appear on the main navigational menu on the experiment page (exp1/index.html). 
	</p>
	<p>
	Finally, we can write any text content after the h2 tag. You can also insert images with img tag.
	</p>
	<p>
	Refer to w3school page for nice introduction to HTML tags.
	<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> W3schools HTML reference </a>
	</p>
<h3> Add the experiment </h3>
	<p>
	First, replace the pendulum.swf file with your experiment.
	Then locate the section with an id as "experiments" inside the content.html file. Replace the embed code so that it points to your experiment.
	For flash based experiments it is easy, just replace the name of swf file with name of your experiment file.
	Refer to web tutorials on embedding java applets or flash objects in HTML pages.
